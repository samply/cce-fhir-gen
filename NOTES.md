# Notes

The CCE FHIR profiles have been created by hand i.e. the values in those XML files are hard-coded. Instead, the profiles should also be derived from the Rust code, so e.g. the `CodeSystem` profiles should be generated by various `enum(s)`.

## Advantages

- The names / URLs etc. (for a `CodeSystem`) could be standardized and various typos / spelling mistakes could be avoided
- The `Catalogue` names could be standardized and kept the same (and no discrepancies will be there)
-
